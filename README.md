# EcommerceBackend

This project is a mock-up of an ecommerce shop that allows users to find and filter products by color, price range,
and category. A user must be logged in to access the ability to add products to a cart and then view/clear that cart.
They can also view and update their profile when logged in.
We used Spring Boot to connect our backend to our front end where we can query our MySQL database
to access data that we then return to our front end and display to user.

## Favorite Code Snippet

![FavoriteCodeSnippet.PNG]()

My favorite code snippet was the principal interface as it allowed me to grab the name of the currently logged in user
which changed the game. I was struggling to figure out how to know which user was logged in and to get that usrs profile
until I came across this code block in the ShoppingCartController.
